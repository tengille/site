### Hunter Seeker

Hunter Seeker was a bit of an exploration into LÖVE and Lua. I was planning on
maybe making an exploration + Zelda 2D sort of game, but like [Nightjar](/projects/nightar), it would have been a large project to undertake and one that I didn't
want to pursue for that long.

LÖVE and Lua were fun to learn and tinker with and it was interesting on how to
read inputs, get 8 way movement implemented, along with some other things.

The code can be found on [my Github](https://github.com/tengille/hunter_seeker).
