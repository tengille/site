### Bike Game

_[ Q4 2012 - Made in Construct 2 ]_

"Bike Game" was a game inspired by [Canabalt](https://canabalt.com/), [Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel](https://battletoads.fandom.com/wiki/Turbo_Tunnel)
and my time riding my bike a fair bit. The goal is to do continually switch lanes, and dodge cars that are coming by you at ever increasing speeds. There's some aesthetic taken from the biking scenes in
[Punch-Out!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Out!!_(NES))

Unfortunately, it is currently unplayable. I do have all the assets, and may remake it in Haxe.
