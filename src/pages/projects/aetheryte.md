### Aetheryte

Aetheryte is a little RubyGem that allows the parsing of Final Fantasy XIV profiles
into JSON, effectively web-scraping.

The background is, a lot of applications that people use in FFXIV leverage the
"profile description" portion of a player's profile to do authorization. Every
application probably writes their own version of this. I've spun up a little server
that allows folks who are doing this to leverage it as their authorization.

_I'll add the server link when its fully up and running (I think I need to pay my Heroku bill)._
