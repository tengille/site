### Pod

_[ 2022 - Made in p5js ]_

Pod was a game I made entirely in JavaScript, using the p5js framework for event
loops. It was a bit of a clone of Adam Saltsman's
[CAPSULE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/303940/CAPSULE/) but without the great
sound design. It was done with zero assets, other than some sounds from
[jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/). The player's ship, stars, and other things were just
done with native p5 shapes, harkening back to an old school retro arcade feeling.

Unfortunately, I've lost all resources for Pod, so no images or gameplay exist ðŸ˜”
