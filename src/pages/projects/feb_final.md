### Feb Final

_[ Q1 2012 - Made in GameMaker ]_

"February No Title Game" was just a game that I wanted to put together after [One Mystic](/projects/one_mystic). Its inspired by the anime [Claymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_(manga)#Anime) and the film
[Valhalla Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Rising_(film))

You are a in a troop, as a child, guarding some form of demon. You're given
a task to go fetch another guard and when you get back the demon is free. The demon
says they'll help you get home as thanks for leaving him alone with only 1 guard,
whether you meant to or not.

While I do have the file for this game, I won't have it posted (yet) as it has
my real name in the credits.
